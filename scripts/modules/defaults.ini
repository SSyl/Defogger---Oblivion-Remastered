# Values set to "game" or left blank will ignore that value and use the game's default instead.
# Distance is in Unreal Units (e.g. 100 = 1 meter, 1000 = 10 meters, 100000 = 1km)
# Explanation of values:
# [Area_Name] <- Name of the area the settings below it will affect. Don't change this as it's hardcoded in the mod.
# Enabled <- Setting this to False makes the game use its default values for that Area_Name (i.e. setting Tamriel_Outside to false makes the outside world use the game's default values for fog)
# FogStartDistance <- Distance at which the base (non-volumetric) fog starts. In Tamriel it's that blue-tinted fog you see everywhere. Increase this to push the fog further back.
# FogCutOffDistance <- Distance that the base fog will be "hard" cut-off. If you want to disable only the base fog but keep the volumetric fog, set both BaseFogStartDistance and BaseFogCutOffDistance to 1 (or any value above 0, as long as it's the same value for both)
# SkyAtmosphereColor <- Controls the color of the base fog outside. Values are in Red, Green, Blue, and Alpha (Transparency) from 0 to 1. If you wanted purple base fog, you could set it to R=0.5,G=0,B=0.5,A=1.  Values for RGB can go above 1 (e.g. to double the blue, you could do B=2). Changing Alpha doesn't seem to have much of an effect unless set entirely off at 0.
# EnableVolumetricFog <- Controls if Volumetric Fog is enabled for the [Area_Name] it's in. For example, if you didn't want Volumetric Fog in Interiors, but you wanted it everywhere else, you could set this to False under [Interior]
# VolumetricStartDistance <-  How far away the Volumetric Fog starts. Use with VolumetricNearFadeInDistance so it doesn't start abrubtly and make it look like a "fog wall".
# VolumetricNearFadeInDistance <- Distance until the Volumetric Fog is at max thickness. For example, setting it to 1000 would mean at 5 meters out the fog would be ~50% thickness and 10 meters would look max thickness.
# VolumetricFogAlbedo <- Essentially the color of Volumetric Fog in Red, Green, Blue, Alpha. If set to its max value of R=255,G=255,B=255,A=255 then it just reflects light with its normal color. If you set it to R=255,G=0,B=0,A=255 the fog will be heavily red tinted.
# VolumetricFogDistance <- How far out the Volumetric Fog goes out. There is a slight performance hit if it's set too high, and a possible performance gain if lowered.

# [Tamriel_Outside] effects outside anywhere in Cyrodiil. Doesn't cover Shivering Isles or Oblivion Planes
[Tamriel_Outside]
Enabled = True                                   # False will ignore any values set in [Tamriel_Outside] and use the game's values instead.
FogStartDistance = 55000                         # [Game default: 0] Setting this higher pushes back the default "light blue" fog you see everywhere.
FogCutOffDistance = game                         # [Game default: 0] Hard cut off for fog. Tip: Setting this and FogStartDistance both to 1 will disable the "base" fog, but still leave volumetric fog on.
SkyAtmosphereColor = R=1,G=1,B=0.66,A=1.0        # [Game default: R=1.0,G=1.0,B=1.0,A=1.0] This controls the color of the "base" fog outside. I set blue to 0.8 to make the fog look more neutral and less blue.
EnableVolumetricFog = game					     # [Game default: True] Setting this to False will disable VolumetricFog only for this world space
VolumetricFogStartDistance = game                # [Game default: 0] This is how far out the fog starts.
VolumetricFogNearFadeInDistance = 4000           # [Game default: 0] How far out it takes for the volumetric fog to go from 0 to 100%. 
VolumetricFogAlbedo = R=255,G=255,B=255,A=255    # [Game default: R=255,G=255,B=255,A=255] The volumetric fog outside seems to have a yellowish/red tint outside, so decreasing the red and green a bit could help.
VolumetricFogDistance = 12000                    # [Game default: 10000] How far out the fog goes. Can come with a slight performance hit.

# [Interior] effects pretty much every interior: crypts, caves, shops, ruins, interiors of Oblivion Gates, etc.
[Interior]
Enabled = True                                   # False will ignore any values set in [Interior] and use the game's values instead.
FogStartDistance = game                          # [Game default: 0] For interiors, this doesn't seem to matter. Setting it close or far doesn't seem change anything. Setting it to "game" in case there's some weird case where it does apply.
FogCutOffDistance = game                         # [Game default: 0] Setting it to "game" in case there's some weird case where it does apply.
SkyAtmosphereColor = game                        # [Game default: R=0.0,G=0.0,B=0.0,A=0.0] For interiors, changing this color doesn't really seem to make any change. Might be scene dependant
EnableVolumetricFog = game                       # [Game default: True] Setting this to false turns off all volumetric fog for this world space [Interior]
VolumetricFogStartDistance = game                # [Game default: 0] This pushes back when the fog starts, but can make the transition abrupt if you don't use it with FadeInDistance.
VolumetricFogNearFadeInDistance = 2500           # [Game default: 0] Setting this to a high value keeps a thin layer of fog that transitions until it reaches full thickness at its max distance. I like values between 2000-3000 
VolumetricFogAlbedo = R=85,G=85,B=85,A=255       # [Game default: 255,255,255,255] This seems to be an extremely subtle change in interiors, but it may depend on the scene itself. I set it to 1/3rd its values so it's a little less bright 
VolumetricFogDistance = game                     # [Game default: 6000] The default may vary. The interiors I tried were all 6000, though.

FogCutOffDistance = game                         # [Game default: 0] Tip: Setting this and FogStartDistance both to 1 will disable the "base" fog, but still leave volumetric fog.

VolumetricFogAlbedo = game                       # [Game default: R=255,G=255,B=255,A=255] This value will get overwritten in the Imperial City, essentially rendering it useless.
